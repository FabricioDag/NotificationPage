## My process
I've built the project using mobile-first workflow and breaking down the major problem in minor ones.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

There are some gaps for improvement, in the future the notifications will be displayed based on a JSON file that contains all the necessary informations.
